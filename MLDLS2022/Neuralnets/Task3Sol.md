### NEURAL NETWORKS
---
Consider the linear regression issue, which we have discussed previously. A loss function is a concept that we have. By reducing the loss function, a neural network narrows in on the proper answer to a problem.
Assume we have the following basic linear equation: y = mx + b. This guesses a y value given some x values.
Predictive models are not always 100% accurate. The loss is a measure of how inaccurate it is. The purpose of machine learning is to reduce the loss function using a training set. This is true for linear regression, neural networks, and other machine learning techniques.
The same basic idea applies to neural networks, except that the inputs and outputs are binary. Perceptrons are the things that do the calculations. They make adjustments to decrease the loss function until the model is extremely precise. Handwriting analysis, for example, may be 99 percent correct.

Neural networks are supposed to function similarly to the human brain. When it comes to identifying handwriting or face recognition, the brain reaches conclusions swiftly. In the instance of face recognition, for example, the brain would ask, "Is it female or male?" Is it white or black? Is it youthful or old? "Does there appear to be a scar?" and so on.
